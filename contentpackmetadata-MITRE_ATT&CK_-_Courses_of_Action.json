Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.\n\nFor efficiency, may protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classified as Asymmetric Cryptography.\n\nPossible playbook uses:\n- The playbook can be used independently to handle and remediate the specific technique.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “Courses of Action - Defense Evasion” playbook to remediate techniques based on the kill chain phase.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Courses of Action” playbook, which can be triggered by different sources and accepts the technique MITRE ATT\u0026CK ID as an input.",

They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.[1][2][3][4] In the case of ransomware, it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted. In some cases, adversaries may encrypt critical system files, disk partitions, and the MBR.\n\nTo maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for encrypting data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other attack techniques like Valid Accounts, OS Credential Dumping, and SMB/Windows Admin Shares.\n\nPossible playbook uses:\n- The playbook can be used independently to handle and remediate the specific technique.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “Courses of Action - Defense Evasion” playbook to remediate techniques based on the kill chain phase.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Courses of Action” playbook, which can be triggered by different sources and accepts the technique MITRE ATT\u0026CK ID as an input.",

The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise.

Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities. Examples of elevated access include: • SYSTEM/root level• local administrator• user account with admin-like access • user accounts with access to specific system or perform specific functionThese techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features that let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.\n\nPossible playbook triggers:\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “Courses of Action - Collection” playbook to remediate techniques based on kill chain phase.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Courses of Action” playbook, that can be triggered by different sources and accepts the technique MITRE ATT\u0026CK ID as an input.\n",

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.\n\nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising a endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.\n\nPossible playbook uses:\n- The playbook can be used independently to handle and remediate the specific technique.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “Courses of Action - Defense Evasion” playbook to remediate techniques based on the kill chain phase.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Courses of Action” playbook, which can be triggered by different sources and accepts the technique MITRE ATT\u0026CK ID as an input.\n",

	"readme": "The process of ingesting quality threat intelligence, mapping the intelligence reports into MITRE ATT\u0026CK tactics and techniques, and then translating this information into reliable and usable remediation steps can be tedious and very time consuming. This MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Courses of Action Pack contains intelligence-driven Courses of Action (COA) defined by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 team, that will enable you to handle MITRE ATT\u0026CK techniques and sub-techniques in an organized and automated manner. This will make sure your organization is not only blocking specific reported IOCs but also taking a more holistic approach to prevent future attacks.\n\nUsing this content Pack, you can automate this whole process and have all of the information gathered in one place to help you keep your organization protected.\nEach technique is mapped out-of-the-box into the specific Courses of Action that your organization needs in order to stay protected, using Palo Alto Networks products.\n\nWith this Pack, you can reduce the time your teams spend on consuming threat intelligence and translating the reports into action items, and on sustaining best practices policies for your security products. \n\n**What does this Pack do?**\n- Automatically maps MITRE ATT\u0026CK Techniques into Courses of Action playbooks.\n- Takes action to remediate the techniques throughout Palo Alto Networks security products, following the MITRE ATT\u0026CK kill chain.\n- Checks existing profiles against best practices and suggests manual or automated policy changes. \n- The playbooks in the Pack can be triggered manually, by a job, by an incident, or by any threat intelligence feed.\n- MITRE ATT\u0026CK techniques are the playbook inputs and therefore playbooks can be triggered by any 3-rd party tools mapping to this framework.  \n- When used with Unit 42 feed ingesting Actionable Threat Objects and Mitigations (ATOMs) - get notified as soon as there is a new threat actor report and take action immediately. \n\nFor more information, please refer to the [MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Courses of Action article](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/packs/courses-of-action).  \n\n\n**MITRE ATT\u0026CK Dashboard**\n![MITRE_Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-dist/content/packs/MITRECoA/readme_images/MITRE_Dashboard.png)\n\n**Unit 42 STIX Report Indicators**\n![Maze_Ransomware](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-dist/content/packs/MITRECoA/readme_images/Maze_Indicator.png)\n\n**MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Courses of Action Sample Playbook**\n![Courses_of_Action](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-dist/content/packs/MITRECoA/readme_images/MITRE_ATT%26CK_CoA_-_T1027.png)\n",
