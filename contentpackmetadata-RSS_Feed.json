Runs enrich indicators command on the extracted indicators. \n\nCortex XSOAR recommends that you configure a job to execute this playbook. \n\n1. Configure a job that will run the *RSS Create Indicators From Report* playbook. \n      1. Select the *Triggered by delta in feed* option.\n      2. Select the feed on which to run the job.\n   \n\n2. Configure input to the *RSS Create Indicators From Report* playbook:\n   \n    - From the context data input: Tag name - the indicator will be tagged with this value when the playbook finishes processing and all the indicators are extracted and relationships created.\n   \n    - From the indicators: Create a query to include only new report indicators that were not processed yet. Recommended query: \"type:Report -tags:{Tag name configured from the context data input} -tags:in_process\". \n   The playbook tags all indicators with the \"in_process\" tag when it starts running, and removes the tag when the playbook ends.\n   If you want the playbook to run on a specific instance (a specific feed), add the following filter to the query: *sourceInstances:\"{the selected instance}\"*.\n\nNote that if you selected the *Triggered by delta in feed* option when configuring the Job, the “Run only on new and modified indicators” playbook option is automatically selected.\n",
